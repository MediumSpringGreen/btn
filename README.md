# Philosophy
> Instead of design headache, deciding what font to use, what color to use, etc. just [choose one button](https://github.com/MediumSpringGreen/btn/tree/main/catalogue) from many pre designed and ready to use buttons and ship faster.ðŸš€

# Rationale behind bundling
> To prevent big eventual bundle sizes and let the bundle optimizers work as intended, no bundling and inital compilation has been done before the usage of the code in the library.
